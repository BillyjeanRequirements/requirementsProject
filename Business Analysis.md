# 1. Introduction
## 1-1. Business purpose
Business Purpose: Amtrak is pursuing the implementation of a new seating system to improve the overall experience for their commuters. The proposed system aims to address the current inefficiencies and inconvenience caused by the manual seat assignment process. By enabling passengers to select their seats via the website, the new system is expected to reduce the time and effort required by employees to manually assign seats, as well as reduce confusion and potential conflicts among passengers. Ultimately, the new seating system is expected to improve customer satisfaction and contribute to Amtrak's overall objective of providing safe, efficient, and reliable transportation services.
## 1-2. Business scope
a) The business domain under consideration is Amtrak, a passenger rail service in the United States.

b) The range of business activities included in the business domain includes ticket sales, train operations, maintenance, and customer service. These activities are performed by various divisions within the organization, such as marketing, operations, finance, and information technology. External entities that relate directly to the business activities include passengers, suppliers, regulatory agencies, and local communities. Environmental entities outside of the scope may include competitors, weather conditions, and geopolitical events.

c) The scope of the system being developed is the implementation of a new seating system for Amtrak's passenger trains. The system will enable passengers to select their seats via the website, and will be integrated with Amtrak's existing ticketing and train management systems. The assumption is that the system will support the business activities of ticket sales, train operations, and customer service, by streamlining the seat selection process and reducing the workload for Amtrak employees. The system will also improve the customer experience and increase passenger satisfaction.
