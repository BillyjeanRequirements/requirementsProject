# 1. Introduction
## 1-1. Business purpose
Business Purpose: Amtrak is pursuing the implementation of a new seating system to improve the overall experience for their commuters. The proposed system aims to address the current inefficiencies and inconvenience caused by the manual seat assignment process. By enabling passengers to select their seats via the amtrak website and app, the new system is expected to reduce the time and effort required by employees to manually assign seats, as well as reduce confusion and potential conflicts among passengers. Ultimately, the new seating system is expected to improve customer satisfaction and contribute to Amtrak's overall objective of providing safe, efficient, and reliable transportation services.
## 1-2. Business scope
a) The business domain under consideration is Amtrak, a passenger rail service in the United States.

b) The range of business activities included in the business domain includes ticket sales, train operations, maintenance, and customer service. These activities are performed by various divisions within the organization, such as marketing, operations, finance, and information technology. External entities that relate directly to the business activities include passengers, suppliers, regulatory agencies, and local communities. Environmental entities outside of the scope may include competitors, weather conditions, and geopolitical events.

c) The scope of the system being developed is the implementation of a new seating system for Amtrak's passenger trains. The system will enable passengers to select their seats via the website, and will be integrated with Amtrak's existing ticketing and train management systems. The assumption is that the system will support the business activities of ticket sales, train operations, and customer service, by streamlining the seat selection process and reducing the workload for Amtrak employees. The system will also improve the customer experience and increase passenger satisfaction.
## 1-3. Overview
Amtrak is a passenger rail service in the United States that operates intercity trains connecting over 500 destinations in 46 states. The major internal divisions of Amtrak include marketing, operations, finance, and information technology.

## 4-3. Business operational constraints
1. Performance constraint: The website should be able to handle a large volume of traffic during peak hours when customers are making reservations for their trips. The website should also be able to provide real-time updates on available seats to customers.

2. Security and privacy: The website should be designed to ensure that customer information is kept secure and their privacy is protected. This includes implementing secure login procedures, secure transmission of data, and ensuring that customer information is not shared with unauthorized parties.

3. Compliance: The website should comply with all relevant laws and regulations related to the storage and handling of customer information. This includes laws related to data protection, privacy, and consumer rights.

4. User experience: The website should be easy to use and navigate, with clear instructions on how to select seats and make reservations. The website should also be accessible to all customers, including those with disabilities.

5. Training and support: Amtrak employees should be trained on how to use the new system, and there should be a support system in place to help customers with any issues they may encounter while using the website.

6. Integration with existing systems: The new system should be integrated with Amtrak's existing reservation and ticketing systems to ensure that customer data is consistent across all systems. This will help to avoid confusion and ensure that customers receive accurate information about their reservations.
## 4-4. Business operational modes
1. Business Continuity Plan: Amtrak should have a well-defined Business Continuity Plan (BCP) in place that outlines how to continue operations during unexpected situations like accidents, natural disasters, or any other major disruptive events. The plan should include a strategy for shifting to manual operations if the proposed system is not available due to any reason.

2. Alternative Booking Options: In the event of the website being unavailable, Amtrak should have alternative booking options available to customers, such as a phone or in-person booking system. These alternative options should be adequately staffed, and employees should be trained on how to handle the increased volume of reservations.

3. Flexibility in Operations: To manage the unsteady state of operations, Amtrak should have a flexible approach to their business operations. They should be prepared to adjust their staffing levels, shift work schedules, and modify their procedures to respond to any sudden surge in demand.

4. Customer Communication: During any unsteady state of business operation, it is crucial to maintain clear communication with customers. Amtrak should have a system in place to provide real-time updates to customers regarding any changes in their travel plans or availability of seats.

5. Back-up and Recovery Plans: To ensure that the proposed system can be restored as quickly as possible after an unexpected disruption, Amtrak should have a robust back-up and recovery plan in place. This includes having a redundant system, regular data backups, and a tested recovery plan that can be executed quickly if needed.

6. Disaster Recovery Plan: Amtrak should have a disaster recovery plan in place that outlines how to resume operations after a significant disruptive event, such as a natural disaster. This plan should include strategies for ensuring employee safety, restoring essential systems and operations, and communicating with customers and stakeholders.
## 4-5. Business operational quality
The level of quality required for the business operation is high. The seating reservation system must be reliable, secure, and user-friendly. It should be able to handle a large volume of traffic during peak hours, provide real-time updates, and ensure that customer information is kept secure and private. Additionally, the system should comply with all relevant laws and regulations related to data protection, privacy, and consumer rights. Finally, the system should be designed to be flexible and scalable to accommodate future changes or updates.

## 4-6. Business structure
1. Organizational structure: Amtrak has a hierarchical organizational structure, with divisions and departments such as Operations, Marketing, Finance, and Information Technology. The system should align with this structure to ensure that it supports the needs of each division or department.

2. Role and responsibility structures: The system should be designed to support the roles and responsibilities of various employees who will be involved in the seating reservation process, such as customer service representatives, train attendants, and IT support staff.

3. Geographic structures: Amtrak operates in multiple locations across the United States, and the system should be designed to support the needs of each location, including variations in local regulations and customer preferences.

4. Resource sharing structures: The system should be designed to support the sharing of resources, such as customer data, between different departments or divisions of the organization. This will help to ensure that customer information is consistent and up-to-date across all systems. Additionally, the system should be scalable and flexible to accommodate future changes or updates to the organization's resource sharing structures.
